                        <p>I was raised in Littleton, Colorado (a suburb of Denver). I love Colorado and like to go back when I can. I am the oldest of three children and so I learned leadership skills from a very early age. In our family, our motto was "Work Hard, Play Hard, Choose the Right, Be Happy!" I loved growing up in a household where these things were emphasized. I developed strong faith in Jesus Christ, learned to love learning, and developed my abilities as an athlete.</p>

                        <h2 id="hs" class="section-heading">High School</h2>
                        <p>I attended Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and graduated in the top 10% of my class. Many people know Columbine High School from the shooting that happened; this is sad because Columbine High School is so much more than a tragedy and is such an amazing place to get an education. I played football and basketball in addition to throwing the shotput and discus. I was an All-State Offensive Lineman for my football team. Below is a video where teachers at Columbine High School (two of which I personally had) talk about their experience with the shooting that occured.</p>

                        <p>I served my mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Budapest, Hungary; I absolutely loved my experience there. I met so many wonderful people and learned how to speak Hungarian. I developed a deeper love for my Savior, Jesus Christ, and gained a stronger testimony of His restored gospel.</p>

                        <h2 id="college" class="section-heading">College Life and Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>I returned home from my mission in 2018, and shortly after, I began attending Brigham Young University. I have been studying finance while at BYU in addition to playing football. If you are interested, you can check out my ESPN profile <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4373631/jt-gentry" target="_blank" title="JT Gentry ESPN profile.">here</a>. The best thing that happened to me while at BYU was marrying my wife. Her name is Kate and we recently welcomed our first child into the world. I am a very happy husband and father!</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">I am so blessed to have found such a wonderful wife (personal photo)!</span>
                        <p>While at college, I have been very busy. However, I have still found time for two of my favorite hobbies: playing basketball and going golfing. Both of these activities motivate me to improve and help me be better physically and mentally.</p>
